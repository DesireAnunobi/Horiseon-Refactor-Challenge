# Module 1 Challenge 

## Description 

This Module 1 Challenge was created for the Front-End Web Developer boot camp students. The website was built to teach and reinforce the basics of HTML, CSS, and Git. A marketing agency has hired us to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. I began with starter code that needed to be modified to make it accessible for all. We used the Console to inspect and debug code. 

What I learnt?
- I learnt more about how to effectively use Git Hub and Git Bash.
- I learnt that commit messages are meant to be specific to improvement/changes made in code.
- I learnt that the order of html element in the code editior can effect positioning of elements.
- I learnt that images need alt attribute for accessiblity purposes

What makes your project stand out? 
- I added a footer to match original website (although it was not included in example screenshot.)

I encountered some challenges on the way including:
- Positioning the nave bar in the header
- Matching the css and html styles
- Positioning paragraphs in the correct place in that section
